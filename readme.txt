### COERCION ###

- Create a variable called `nameAndAge` and assign it the value of `name` and `age` concatenated together. For example, if `name` is `"Joshua"` and `age` is `25`, `nameAndAge` should be `"Joshua25"`

### MATH OPERATORS ###

- Create a variable called `product` and assign it the value of `age` times `current year`



### FUNCTIONS ###

- Create a function called `helloWorld` that returns the string `"Hello World"`

- Create a function called `add` that takes two arguments and returns their sum

- Create a function called `multiply` that takes two arguments and returns their product

- Create a function called `greet` that takes a single argument and returns the string `"Hello <argument>!"`. For example, `greet("Joshua")` should return `"Hello Joshua!"`



### lOGICAL OPERATORS ###

- Create a function called `or` that takes two arguments and returns `true` if either argument is `true` and `false` otherwise

- Create a function called `not` that takes a single argument and returns `true` if the argument is `false` and `false` otherwise



5. Commit your changes using `git commit -m "<your-first-name>"`. For example, `git commit -m "joshua"`

6. Push your changes to the remote repository using `git push origin <your-first-name>`. For example, `git push origin joshua`

7. Open a pull request on GitHub

8. Wait for the pull request to be merged

9. Pull the latest changes from the remote repository using `git pull origin master`

10. Repeat steps 3-9 for the remaining exercises
